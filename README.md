# Covid-Deaths-Vaccinations-Project

# Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data from 2020 to 2021. Using BigQuery, I wrote SQL queries and transferred them to a Kaggle notebook using SQLite. Furthermore, I developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize insights such as the percentage of population infected by the virus per country, global statistics, and total deaths per continent.
